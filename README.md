As a part of practice project, I tried to rebuild my entier website www.simplepycodes.com with simple flask-HTML-CSS-Bootstrap. 
The intention and focus of the project is to learn Flask framework in practical way by creating real project.
The pages are created with raw HTML and Bootstrap. Smtplib is used for mail the handling which I might change later for better performance.
The file structure is very simple and straight forward.
The project is stll under development. 
Static folder is empty i havent done much CSS. I tried to use different file structure but it might not be the best way.
I used pythonanywhere.com to host the site and you can check the online version at:
